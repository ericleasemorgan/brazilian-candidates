Hi Eric, the 2012 CSV files are located here: http://agencia.tse.jus.br/estatistica/sead/odsele/consulta_cand/consulta_cand_2012.zip Â This zip file is structured very similarly to the 2016 document, with one giant CSV file for all elections, and then individual CSV files for each Brazilian state.

Downloaded and cached. Thank you. --Eric
