Hi Eric, the 2012 CSV files are located here: http://agencia.tse.jus.br/estatistica/sead/odsele/consulta_cand/consulta_cand_2012.zip  This zip file is structured very similarly to the 2016 document, with one giant CSV file for all elections, and then individual CSV files for each Brazilian state.

So I went straight to the Eleição Municipal 2012 website ( http://divulgacandcontas.tse.jus.br/divulga/#/) to see if the candidates' platforms (their "propostas de governo") were there. They were! Google just didn't seem to find the PDFs well. So, I got to clicking around and realized it would be super easy to predict the URL of any candidate platform, using the CSV file of candidates for 2012.

Any mayor's platform will be at this URL: http://divulgacandcontas.tse.jus.br/dados/2012/1699/BA/x/11/y/proposta.pdf, where x = the value from Column G and y = the value from Column L.

Each 2016 platform contains an unpredictable number in its file path -- the digits right after the word "governo." It seems to be random (or at least, unpredictable) based on anything in the spreadsheet.

Mark, thank you for following through, and what you outline is not a surprise. Next step, Mark, will you please send me a list of one or more URLs pointing to the 2012 CSV files, and I will begin to process them in a manner similar to the 2016 files. Jake, does sound like a good idea to you? --Eric
